[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am a final year undergraduate student of computer science at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. I am currently the class valedictorian and have also served as the captain of the tennis team and as the vice chairperson of the IEEE student branch.\nI am currently pursuing my undergraduate thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics under Dr. Andrew Yates and Dr. Paramita Mirza.\nI was recently a part of the IUSSTF-Viterbi programme 2019!\nMy research interests include reinforcement learning, deep learning and natural language processing. I like thinking about and working on different applications of RL in the real world - like dialogue systems, robotics and personalized learning. I\u0026rsquo;m also interested in thinking about the modeling of RL problems and I often find myself asking the question \u0026lsquo;What are the properties of a good state space/reward function?\u0026rsquo;. Recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve also found the idea of meta learning very intriguing and has made me think of the question \u0026lsquo;Can I teach an agent that has learned to play tennis, to play badminton?\u0026rsquo;. I find neural networks very fascinating as well and often think about how backpropagation works in different deep learning models. A lot of my work also involves NLP and IR and I am very interested in exploring the intersection of NLP/IR and RL.\nIn the past I\u0026rsquo;ve had the good fortune of working closely with some amazing researchers such as Prof. N. L. Bhanu Murthy, Prof. Aruna Malapati, Prof. Kallirroi Georgila and Prof. David Traum.\nIf you are interested in my work or would like to chat about technical interests we might share, feel free to get in touch!\n","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://skandavaidyanath.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a final year undergraduate student of computer science at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus.
